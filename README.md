# code-club
A repository for the code-club sessions. Use this to store your solutions!

The problems for each week will be stored in separate folders on the `main` branch. Use a separate branch (preferably identifiable as you) to upload your solutions to the appropriate folder for each session.

There will be an easy, medium and hard problem for each session. Feel free to chose whichever option you like, but be prepared to discuss your solution in the meeting! If you want to stretch yourself, write unit-tests to test your code, or try a new programming language!
